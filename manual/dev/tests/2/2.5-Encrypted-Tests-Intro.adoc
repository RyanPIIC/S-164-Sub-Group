There are additional tests provided in “7 ENC Data Management [Optional]”. These are provided to assist manufacturers who have included additional ENC Data Management functions into their systems and are fully described in sections 2.5.7i), 2.5.7j) and 2.5.7k).

 Test Definitions

Default test data parameters

The ENC permits that accompany the encrypted ENC test data have been generated for the User Permit specified below. To carry out the tests described in this document manufacturers will have to create a hard lock device or program their software with the following manufacturer information and hardware ID (HW_ID). 

Manufacturer ID: (M_ID)		=	10 	(or 3130 hexadecimal)
Manufacturer Key: (M_KEY)	=	10121 	(or 3130313231 hexadecimal)
Hardware ID: (HW_ID)		= 	12345 	(or 3132333435 hexadecimal)
USERPERMIT             		=	66B5CBFDF7E4139D5B6086C23130

This is the official manufacturer information issued for and by the Scheme Administrator (IHB) and is provided expressly for the purpose of producing encrypted ENC test data. This data is provided specifically for the following purposes:

•	OEM Type approval against the S-64 Test Data for Encrypted ENCs (This document).
•	OEM and Data Server self certification of their systems against the S-63 Data Protection Scheme.

Test Certificate and Public Key

The official IHO Scheme Administrator Certificate (IHO.CRT) should be used in the test data unless a different certificate or public key file is specified in the test description.
