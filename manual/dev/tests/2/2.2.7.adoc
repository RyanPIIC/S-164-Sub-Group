a|The system shall report any cell(s) that have been identified as cancelled at load time. A message shall be displayed informing the user of the cell name.
Depending on the method adopted by the OEM for managing cancelled cells one of the following conditions must be observed:
1.	The cancelled cell cannot be viewed in the ECDIS
2.	The cancelled cell can be viewed in the ECDIS with the warning message defined in S-63 and specified below:
“Cell <name> has been cancelled and may not be up to date. Under no circumstances should it be used for primary navigation”.

Clarification: Systems that remove cells without consulting the user do not have to provide a warning message at load time.
