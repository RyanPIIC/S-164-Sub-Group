= S-57 Testing

== Introduction
This section describes how S-57 functionality shall be tested. The idea is that the TDS Manual for S-57 is referenced from this section and the data is unchanged from that which is currently used.

This is, therefore, a _very_ short section.

It should also explain how the S-57 data forms part of DF mode testing.
